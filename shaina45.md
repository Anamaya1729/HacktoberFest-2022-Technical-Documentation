# User Interface and User Experience(UI/UX)
The basic introduction of UX/UI Design. I hope you find it interesting and inspiring to begin your design journey.
Let’s begin, often firms and newbie designers like myself get the whole role thing mixed up in the sense of not fully understanding what each role stands for and how they operate.

### A brief history of User Experience and User Interface Design :

The field of user experience design is a conceptual design discipline and has its roots in human factors and ergonomics, a field that, since the late 1940s, has focused on the interaction between human users, machines, and the contextual environments to design systems that address the user’s experience. Donald Norman, a professor, and researcher in design, usability, and cognitive science, coined the term “user experience,” and brought it to a wider audience.
It's being said that UI/UX plays a crucial role in product design. But why is it so?
Before divising deep into this question let's first understand what actually is UI/UX.

User Interface(UI) and User Experience(UX) designs are the most important terms in Web and App development and often underlooked during software development, but they play a big silent role in attracting customers by providing a visually appearing, smooth and functional experience to them.

Adobe XD is a very popular free to use tool that allows us to create wireframes and prototypes that helps us in designing Web and mobile applications.


## Are they the same?

Most of the time these two roles get misinterpreted meanwhile they are different but both work together to build a usable product for the user. What could be the difference? Let’s find out.
A typical illustration to explain the difference is the human body, separating the skeleton from the flesh, the skeleton refers to the UX design showing the architectural blueprint of the product while the Flesh refers to the UI design which relates to how the product looks and feel to the outer eye of a user.

A UX designer considers the user’s entire journey to solve a particular problem; what steps do they take? What tasks do they need to complete? How straightforward is the experience? Much of their work focuses on finding out what kinds of problems and pain-points users come up against, and how a certain product might solve them.
UI designer focuses on all the details that make this journey possible. That’s not to say that UI design is all about looks; UI designers have a huge impact on whether or not a product is accessible and inclusive.


## Conclusion :

A UI designer actually creates pages that follow the path that UX designer has chosen for the user. UX designer has to keep in mind the user's goal. UX is a highly analytical and logical thing.
