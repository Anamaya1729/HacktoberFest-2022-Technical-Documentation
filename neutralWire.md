## *Responsiveness in Web Development* üßê
* Responsive Web design is the approach that suggests that design and development should respond to the user‚Äôs behavior and environment based on screen size, platform and orientation.
* The practice consists of a mix of flexible grids and layouts, images and an intelligent use of CSS media queries. As the user switches from their laptop to iPad, the website should automatically switch to accommodate for resolution, image size and scripting abilities.

## *Animation in Web Development* üòØ
* Animation is not just for cartoons anymore. From full-screen moving images to small hover effects, touches of animation are popping up everywhere. Animation is trendy, fun, and user-friendly. And the obstacles to using animation have started to fall. With most users on high-speed connections and the ease of creating anything from simple movements or a silly gif to several minutes of action, animations have become practical and useful web design tools.

### *Types of Animations*
### **1. Hover**

CSS hover effects are applied for images, buttons, hovering over links, blocks, etc. Very often on websites, you could see a change in the design of links or buttons on hover. A special pseudo-class: hover in CSS allows implementing this task. These layout techniques are applied to:

Effect buttons and links.
* Hover images.
* CSS library (included separately).

### **2. Page Motion**
Whole page animation as an effect may usually mean the slight movements of the entire website background. No wonder, Motion helps make a UI expressive and easy to use.  Using page motion graphics may help you to enhance your website in many ways. The major thing here will be not to overdo. Keep it a harmony.

### **3. Scrolling**
Here the principle is still the same: what you need to draw the attention of the visitor to goes in the first place and is highlighted while scrolling up and down. So, if you think it‚Äôs time to add some animation to your page when a visitor scrolls, go ahead.

### **4. Backgrounds**
In traditional animation, background layouts are more like line drawings of the background for a scene. So, in web design, it‚Äôs instead an environment on your website where the users get. The animation effect is added to provide more visual interest to your website background and the interaction.

### **4. Attracting Attention**
Of course, if you apply some Fast animations in your website design, they are more likely to attract your user‚Äôs attention when they happen outside the user‚Äôs focus.  The motion added to motionless areas is the first to grab your attention and engage to spend some more time on.

### **5. Navigation and Menus**
While using animation effects here, when the menu items appear, the screen overlaps. When you click on the menu elements, a smooth transition of the underline may be used for the active link, etc. Transforms and animations are also used in navigation with the transition property.
