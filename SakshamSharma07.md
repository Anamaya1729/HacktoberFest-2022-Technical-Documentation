# Client-Server Architecture
Client-server architecture, alternatively called a client-server model, is a network application that breaks down tasks and workloads between clients and servers that reside on the same system or are linked by a computer network.

Client-server architecture typically features multiple users’ workstations, PCs, or other devices, connected to a central server via an Internet connection or other network. The client sends a request for data, and the server accepts and accommodates the request, sending the data packets back to the user who needs them.

This model is also called a client-server network or a network computing model.

To sum it up briefly:

First, the client sends their request via a network-enabled device
Then, the network server accepts and processes the user request
Finally, the server delivers the reply to the client

## The Characteristics of Client-Server Architecture
Client-server architecture typically features the following characteristics:

Client and server machines typically require different hardware and software resources and come from other vendors.
The network has horizontal scalability, which increases the number of client machines and vertical scalability, an then moves the entire process to more powerful servers or a multi-server configuration.
One computer server can provide multiple services simultaneously, although each service requires a separate server program.
Both client and server applications interact directly with a transport layer protocol. This process establishes communication and enables the entities to send and receive information.
Both the client and server computers need a complete stack of protocols. The transport protocol employs lower-layer protocols to send and receive individual messages.

## Visualizing Client-Server Architecture

## Advantages of Client-Server Architecture
1. Management is Easy –  It is rather easy to manage the files because they are all stored on one server. Client-server networks have the best management to track and find records of required files.
2. Easily Accessible – Clients can log into the system regardless of their location or their platform of choice, allowing each employee to access their corporate information without having to use a terminal mode or a processor.
3. Servers are Scalable –  A client-server network is highly scalable. Whenever the user needs, they can add more resources such as clients and servers, thus increasing the size of the server without any interruption. Due to the fact that the server is centralized, permission to network resources is not an issue, so very few staff members are required for configurations even if the size increases.
4. Centralized Control – Client-server networks have the advantage of centralized control since all information is stored in a single location. Since the network administrator has full control over management and administration, this is especially beneficial. As a result, any problems that arise throughout the entire network can be solved from one central location. As a result, it has also become much easier to update data and resources.
5. Security – Due to its centralized architecture, client-server networks protect data well. A single backup can be used to recover all of the files if the data are lost, such as imposing credentials like username and passwords. Another method of enforcing access controls is imposing credentials like username and password.

## Disadvantages of Client-Server Architecture
1. Less Robust – Due to client-server networks’ centralized nature, in case the main server undergoes failure or interference, the entire network will be interrupted. Thus, client-server networks are less robust.
2. Requires Regular Maintenance – Servers will run continuously on the network. This means they must be properly maintained. If there are any problems, they should be fixed immediately. A network manager should be appointed to maintain the server.
3. Requires Cost –  In a client-server network, the cost of setting up and maintaining the server is usually very high, just as it is on the network operations. Because the networks are powerful, they can be expensive to purchase. Thus, not all users will be able to take advantage of them.
4. Network Congestion – If too many clients access a single server, it may result in crashes or slowed-down connectivity. An overloaded server presents many problems when accessing information.

## Conclusion
The client-server architecture enables updates to a shared database from multiple users through a graphical user interface. All businesses, big or small, use the power of networking to grow and digitalize their businesses, market their products, and update themselves on news and events in their particular fields. So this article helps you to understand how networking establishes strategies for communication for the different types of organizations.
